# Clustering-Analysis-using-K-means-and-Fuzzy-C-means-algorithm
One of the popular machine learning technique is unsupervised learning . Using unsupervised machine learning techniques machine learns to assign a data in particular cluster or
classes based on the feature or attribute of the observation or data .Classes or cluster are
constructed such that there is high intra class similarity and low inter class similarity .
One interesting thing in unsupervised learning is that ; here there is no response variable
belonging to each data or observation thus in general we say in unsupervised learning
there is no supervision of any response variable while assigning the observation to different classes .

In our report we will present the clustering analysis of country dataset using two popularily known clustering method namely :

    (i) K-Means Clustering (Hard clustering ) :- Each data point belong to exactly one cluster
    
    (ii) Fuzzy C-means Clustering (Soft clustering ):- Each data point belong to more than one cluster based on its belongingness or membership to clusters
